These are Verilog projects targeting the Atrix7 FPGA by Xilinx. The development board used is the Arty A7-357 from Digilent, Inc. Included are the Verilog source file(s), the testbench and user constraints for the Arty A7-35T. Some of the projects are general enough to be easily moved to other FPGA platforms.

The purpose of this repo is to be a source of working Verilog examples to aid in learning the HDL by doing.
